# Jockey

a little dj-like music toy :>

## How to use

1. Go to the [Jockey website](https://thatotherandrew.github.io/Jockey/)
2. Search for samples (loaded from [Freesound](https://freesound.org/))
3. Select samples in the dropdown
4. Use the slider to set a playback speed, or drag the vinyl record to scratch it!

> [!TIP]
> For best results, try using keywords such as "loop", "100bpm", "Am", etc. when searching for samples!
> For example: "100bpm lofi drum loop"
